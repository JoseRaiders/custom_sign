# Custom Sign Builder

This was a code example from the book JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY. The example is to design your own custom sign with this interactive tool (please note, it's currently static. Improvements to be worked on). Get instant quotes based on sign size and see how your text looks on the finished product.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the custom sign name
- Total number of tiles (including spaces)
- The amount of the sign (subtotal, shipping and grand total)
- Finally, when clicking the "Pay Now" button, an alert will display, which is made possible with a click event listener

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media Queries
- JavaScript - variables, elements and event listener

### What I learned

Completing the static code challenge has helped me continue to build muscle memory as I dive further into JavaScript. It has helped me gain a better understanding of how media queries adapt the design for different screens.
